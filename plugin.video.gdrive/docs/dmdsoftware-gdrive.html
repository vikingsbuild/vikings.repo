<h1>ddurdle's XBMC / KODI Cloud Service Plugins</h1>

Some comments about the dmdsoftware.net pass-through:
<ul>
<li>One-time use code.<p>You provide the Google Drive plugin with a code that you receive from Google when you authenticate my plugin to access your account.  This is a one-time use code that you provide the XBMC / KODI plugin, which is passed through dmdsoftware.net where the server appends my client ID and client secret, and the responding authorization and refresh tokens is sent back to the XBMC / KODI plugin, where it is stored.  At no time is the code, refresh or authorization tokens saved on dmdsoftware.net.  The one-time code immediately expires when it is used to redeem an authorization token.</p>
<li>Renewing authorization<p>When the authorization token expired (after 60 mins), a refresh token is passed by XBMC / KODI plugin is passed through dmdsoftware.net where the server appends my client ID and client secret, and the responding authorization token is sent back to the XBMC / KODI plugin, where it is stored.  At no time is the refresh or authorization tokens saved on dmdsoftware.net.</p>
<li>Revoking authorization<p>You can revoke any authorization and refresh  tokens by visiting <a href=https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions>https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions</a></p>
</ul>

<li>Authorize for READ-ONLY Google Drive access.<p>Open in a web browser the following URL <a href=https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?approval_prompt=force&scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly&redirect_uri=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob&response_type=code&client_id=772521706521-bi11ru1d9h40h1lipvbmp3oddtcgro14.apps.googleusercontent.com>https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?approval_prompt=force&scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly&redirect_uri=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob&response_type=code&client_id=772521706521-bi11ru1d9h40h1lipvbmp3oddtcgro14.apps.googleusercontent.com</a>.  Authorize the KODI GDrive plugin.  You will be presented with a "code".  This is the OAUTH2 code.  Keep a copy of this code for the following step.  <img src='http://dmdsoftware.net/images/gdrive-code.png'></p>
<li>Add OAUTH2 code to the XBMC / KODI plugin using <b>any ONE</b> of the following options.
<ul>

<li>Edit the <b>settings.xml</b> file in the operating system file  <i>~/.xbmc/userdata/addon_data/plugin.video.gdrive/settings.xml</i>.  Locate the field  &lt;setting id="gdrive#_code" value="" /&gt; where # represents the # corresponding to the account # you entered in the prior step when you set the username.  Enter the code inside the quotes for value="".
<li><b>[best option]</b> Create a .STRM file to create your username + code all in a single step.<p>Best option for systems without a keyboard.  Create a .STRM file that contains the following entry.  Then load this .STRM file in XBMC-> Videos -> Files.  This will register the account and code without having to manually entering them.<br>
