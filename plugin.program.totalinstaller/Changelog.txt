v.3.0:

--- Improved NaN backup method, now includes full addon structure if item is a dependency of another addon.
--- Only one simple install option, if you want to copy library, kodi profiles etc this will be added via maintenance.
--- All builds should be created using NaN method, size is very small and it just works much better. However support is there for the old method still but it's not recommended.
--- Apostrophe's can now be used in the filename when adding build.
- Added option for running a cache cleaning service in addon settings. Removes textures not used in past 14 days.

- Not totally addon related, it sort of is... Check out the mycontent area on noobsandnerds. You now have access to all your tutorials, builds and downloads.
- Re-worked maintenance section much more noob friendly and added these new functions:
--- Check For Special Characters - This will search a path for any files with non-ASCII chars and can delete them.

- Addons section completely redone:
--- 2 options for Install method, either the old way or the new recommended way which ensures latest is installed.
--- If addon is installed it will notify you and you can run the addon direct from menu.
--- If addon hasn't installed correctly or updated yet you can force update or just choose option 2.

- Community Builds completely redone:
--- All new builds created will be much smaller in size and will only install content not already on the device.
--- Updates will now only take seconds to do and will only require force close if guisettings has changed.
--- You can now add your own build lists or use this addon to integrate other wizards via the settings.
--- If broken build is found (from third party list) it will try and fix it.
--- If broken build is beyond repair it will notify you rather than crashing out with no message.

- Tutorials:
--- You can now enable/disable all the different tutorials sections, we've left the most popular on by default.


- NEW noobsandnerds keywords:
--- You can now create your own artwork packs, addon packs... anything you want!

INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a zip file of the content you want in your keyword. Example, if you just want to create an addon pack
you would just zip up the addons folder. If you wanted addons AND the addon_data for some of these addons you would
zip up both the addons folder and the userdata/addon_data folder so your zip would look like something like this:

uk_pack.zip
---addons
-------plugin.video.iplayer
-------plugin.video.itv
-------plugin.video.ukplay
---userdata
-------addon_data
---------------plugin.video.iplayer

You can of course zip up absolutely anything you want so get creative, maybe start creating artwork packs that
people can use in their community builds. So long as everyone agrees to use the same file structure they will be
universal. We would recommend for artwork creating a folder called "background_art" in userdata and then all
community builders can link their skins to those folders. So for example you may have something like:

starwars.zip
---userdata
------background_art
---------livetv
------------<pic1.jpg>
------------<pic2.jpg>
---------movies
------------<pic1.jpg>
------------<pic2.jpg>
------------<pic3.jpg>
------------<pic4.jpg>

You get the idea!

Once you've got your zip file upload it to somewhere like archive.org or copy.com, find the final resolved URL
(the one when you type it in a browser it will just start downloading without the need to press a button).
Next just go to http://urlshortbot.com and use the word noobs followed by your keyword. In the starwars example
above we would just type in noobsstarwars as the shortened name and in Kodi we just type "starwars" for
the content to be installed!

- Added service, this allows for internet connection check and CB notifications.

Version 2.0:
- A complete re-write, all my own code apart from the handful of modules not obfuscated.
- The default.py is now obfuscated due to some morons stealing work without crediting the original author and also removing licenses.
Sorry about that, it goes against everything I believe in but until these idiots are dealt with it will stay this way.
