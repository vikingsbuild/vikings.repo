This is a new Project to try and unify MultiScraper forks scrapers all into one pack. This is based on projects from those listed below.
I respect everything they've done for the scene and they all deserve their credit for their work in whatever capacity they have contributed.
I thank everyone and i hope that everyone can help the community have a unified scraper pack, with no more drama :)

- Lambda
- TKNorris
- Mr.Blamo
- Nixgates
- Gaia Team
- I-A-C
- WilsonMagic
- 13Clowns
- Eggman
- Jor-El
- Maud'Dib
- Jewbmx
- Team Supremacy
- Team Colossus
- Team Universal
- 123Venom

Note: Any scraper with credit removed is at the request of the dev that made it, all credit was left intact
